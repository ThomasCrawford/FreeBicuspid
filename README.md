An approach to finding free-bicuspid hyperbolic 3-manifolds

# What is this?

We can track the structure of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds (3D shapes with 'weird' curving structure) with diagrams known as maximal cusp diagrams (aka Horoball diagrams). These are images of maximal cusp diagrams for a specific type of such manifold (free bicuspid). Each of these are parameterized by an angle of rotation (t) and a separation distance (a) between the largest circles.  

The number of circles drawn is limited by computation time.  Since there are infinitely many smaller and smaller circles, we impose a minimum radius cutoff.  This can result in chunks of circles not appearing. For example, in the gifs, patches or loops seem to pop into existance -- this is mearly an artifact of the programing.

Each of the images in Pictures is characterized by a sequence "pointing" right at another sequence.  This is easiestly seen 1_3.png, but with better resolution is true for all.  Look for the "whitespace circles" that are most obvious in 0.png and 1_3.png but may require squinting for others.

Clean up DrawDiagrams to make it user friendly
Include detailed descritions here for both geometers and non-geometerspython
