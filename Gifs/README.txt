Here are a few images and GIFs of free bicuspid manifolds,
usually of "optimal" parameter points.  That is, with a mutual limit point.

This collection is a work in progress, TODO:
	Include Titles, descriptions
	Include a vs t graphs in the GIFs
	Generate gif for 0<t<1 degree


Existing files:
Version2_64.gif has 600 images for t between 0 and 60.  The title is the angle (t) value
