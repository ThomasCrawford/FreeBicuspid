Here are a few images and GIFs of free bicuspid manifolds,
usually of "optimal" parameter points.  That is, with a mutual limit point.

This collection is a work in progress, TODO:
	Include Titles, descriptions
	Include a vs t graphs in the GIFs
	Generate gif for 0<t<1 degree


# Existing files:
Full.gif has 600 images for t between 0 and 60.  The title is the angle (t) value.
HighRes folder has higher resolution versions of some of the following
0.png is the original (Ian Agol) with t=0, a=2
1_3.png has t = 19.4382900608, a =1.92019646152
1_21.png is the "1,21" t = 0.438697559036, a =1.97984522727 solution
41_99.png has t = 24.7106915714 a = 1.90918864274, and is the 'best' (smallest a) current construction
The zoomOut versions show the bigger context, with multiple parabolic transformations visible.
